The word alumni refers to a former student of a school, college or university.
There is also a strong probability that your institution will already have resources,such as a database (if not several), historical files, some donors (though they may not call them that) and an ad hoc history of previous philanthropy. This history of previous attempts to establish a development operation is important to understand,as it may well influence (negatively or positively) your colleagues’ view of what you are trying to build.
A positive relationship can start with a simple smile, gesture to welcome the student into the classroom. 
The initiation of an authentic relationship by a teacher with a student can result positively for a student’s desire to prioritize life of learning and succeeding. Teacher-student relationships begin the first day of school. Many teachers use “ice breaker” activities for both students and the teacher to learn fun and interesting facts about one another. 
Students of all grade levels desire to impress the teacher either with their aptitude for learning, or their unique talents. Students feel comfortable sharing their true self when the relationship with the teacher is secure and a level of trust has been achieved. The next level for teacher-student relationships involves mutual vulnerability where both individuals feel comfortable to sometimes share sensitive information. Once the teacher-student relationship is established, students will organically evolve into a confident and independent thinker and active learner, making teacher-student relationships extremely important and necessary in an educational setting.
This is the end.
